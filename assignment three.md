Multi-language Design Smells: A Backstage Perspective 
# INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION: 
IN this program we describe you that the Modern application have been moving to the single language so that It towards combination into several programming languages. The developers often strength and take advantages for the several programming languages. 
                                                  In the modern era developers build the several languages for make system easily. In facebook the javascript integrated in these sites. The scientist describe in 2018 in the java language and its misuse and when it combine C++ code. The  both languages consequently multi language system presented that compared to mono language system. And the software must be se the quality to studied the literature and often related to occurrences of patterns and anti patterns and smell.  
The multi languages system prevented with logical advances the developers build the programming languages and create the better quality of language and it avoide bad practice like catalog are the bad. We plan to perform an open and a closed survey targeting developers in general but also developers that contributed to those systems.We will survey developers about the perceived prevalence of those smells, their severity and impact on software quality attributes. 
 
# RESEARCH METHODOLGY: 
in these types of language the experimental protocol consist to survey the participants had to give answers on checkedMarket websites. Both types of survays includes the preamble information and and investigates through its principles. And the investigator team do the ethical rights and also have responsibilities of investigators and their participants.
# RESULT:              
The scientist and developers makes easy and fast execution languages so that their program execute in several languages.
