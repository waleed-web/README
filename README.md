## CONFERENCE:
An Empirical Study on the Impact of Deimplicitization on Program Comprehension

## INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION:
In this Application frameworks and Ruby on Rails  introduce abstractions these types of application designes for the simply and for the purpose of use to particulary applications.
these types of application introduces for the high learning because it have to be justified results.and their productivity increase for proffesional developers.
             the importance of of Ruby on Rails, its abstractions is this that these types of impiciation prove the igh level language programm , and abstraction for these frameworks. the deimplicitization are also a mportant programm for use the framework. and the second is konure its specifical work that when the konure execute program then the the konure proxy collected the traffic between the database and the programm. 
## RESEARCH METHODOLOGY:
this experiment assign into two groups.
Control group:
            the  Ruby on Rails source code. are that group that participent that shown only implicit programms.
 Treatement group:
            In this group the participants both programms the impicit programm and their corresponding deimplicitized programs,both the Ruby on Rails source code and the corresponding deim-plicitized Python routine.
            in this programm provide the study enviroment where start tast warm and explain their setting and in this programm gives the syntex highlighted and they don't allow to edit the execute or modify the code.
get_admin_pages_id (conn , inputs):util.clear_warnings()outputs = []s0 = util.do_sql(conn , "SELECT`pages`.*  FROM`pages`WHERE`pages`.`id`= :x0 LIMIT 1", {'x0':inputs[0]})outputs.extend(util.get_data(s0,'pages','id'))outputs.extend(util.get_data(s0,'pages','title'))outputs.extend(util.get_data(s0,'pages','slug'))outputs.extend(util.get_data(s0,'pages','body'))returnutil.add_warnings(outputs)

## REASULT:
      In this programm we find the result that the Ruby and Rials, gives the simply development platform for the developers. so that the increase his productivity and abstractions.
